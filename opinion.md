I am Senthil and my opininon based on my usage of Rubymotion




REPL the irb equivalent on rubymotion is awesome and would make us more productive than our obj-c counterparts

being a rails developer all these years I dont like IDE's, , having a old mbp, I dread to open xcode, consumes so much memory, 
 also to update those humongous install files



rake based task execution, I love it



questions
=========

* how instrumentation is handled?

* why no sample ipad apps?



suggestions
===========

* like in ruby on rails the default project should create .gitkeep in all the folders which are default like resources
